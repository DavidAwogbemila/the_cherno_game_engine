# the_cherno_game_engine
This repository contains code I write while following Yan Chernikov's game engine series on YouTube

Quite honestly, I'm mainly doing this to get a feel of what it is to build a sizeable C++ project/application and sharpen my C++ skills; not so much for the Game Engine dev knowledge.
